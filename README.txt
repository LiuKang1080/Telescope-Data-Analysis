1) Make sure that the telescope data file that needs to be analyzed (.dat file) is in the same directory as Telescope_Data_Analysis.py

2) Start Telescope_Data_Analysis.py by double clicking it and enter the full data file    name (including extension) when prompted to ex. "frbs.dat"

3) The program will do calculations for the highest elevation of an object and output a file called "FRBS_Calculations.log" if it is the first time running the program. Within the file are the object's FRBName, Elevation and Azimuth. Further calculations will add the times and results in the same log file.

4) If a calculation is not presented after running the program check the "Error_Logs.log", an error might have occurred and a traceback is provided.

5) After the program is finished it will prompt you to press enter twice, this will close the program completely.
